Number 1.

There is an issue when an undie script sources undies as follows:
```
. undies
```
and then we pass a valid path to this script as an argument.
```
$ ./script.undies /path/to/file
```
In this case, it will try to source it (at line 70)

Number 2.

Improve the help command.
```
Usage:
$ ./script.undies [tasks]

Available Tasks:
- task1
- list
- task4
- delete [arg]
- help [task]
```
