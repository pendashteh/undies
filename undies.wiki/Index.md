## What is undies?

`undies` is a library and framework for writing software in Bash. When used as a framework, the resulting software is called an Undies app. Any other software may also utilise the library tool that comes with `undies` without the need to use the framework.

In this book, we cover both these use cases: [[Framework|Undies as a framework]] and [[Library|#Undies as a library]].
